Refer to below links for more details.

- [Nextjs environment setup](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/environment-variables)
- [Better-Auth environment setup](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation#set-environment-variables)
  - `BETTER_AUTH_HASH_COST` is configuration for how slow/fast password hash/verify functions work depending on the environment

#### Checklist

    - options
      - `local`: local `public` folder is used
      - `vercel-blob`: [Vercel blob store key is needed](https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-blob)

#### Samples

- provided in `/env_samples/` directory

### Install node modules

```bash
npm install
```

- Note: with `package-lock.json`, `npm install` should work fine. Without it there might be [issue while installing cypress.](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/29204)
- Solution: If you are installing latest versions without `package-lock.json` then
  - install `cypress` first: `npm install cypress@latest --save-dev --ignore-scripts`
  - then `npm i` as usual

### Setup database

- Check prisma configuration
- Check npm scripts in `package.json` based on workflow choices
- Generate initial migrations.

```bash
npm run dev:db:migrate
```

### Run server

Refer to `package.json` for npm scripts to run for dev, test and production. e.g.

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Run tests

Refer to `package.json` for npm scripts to run tests. Currently e2e tests are setup to run auth and admin user flows.

```bash
npm run test
```

Then in separate terminal

```bash
npm run test:cypress:e2e
```
